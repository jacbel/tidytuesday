This repo holds my contributions to the [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project. I will contribute as often as I can, but probably won't be able to make it every week.

If you download the Github Repo, you should be able to run my code to reproduce or improve my contributions. If you have suggestions for improvements or any feedback, feel free to get in touch!
